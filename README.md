# admin-dashboard - [Live Preview](https://porobertdev.github.io/admin-dashboard/)

This project is part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The project's lesson can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

The design file was provided, but I [used Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/49mFzqnnlPiUNWFuCaxFiw/TOP-admin-dashboard?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=y7tZPg9vq849Borb-1https:/) when I was thinking about how to divide the whole layout, so I drew some lines to get a general idea.
